# Landau–Zener Simulation with Harmonic Perturbation

Numerical study of the Landau–Zener transition under harmonic perturbation, completed as part of the Quantum Mechanics II assignment at IIT Delhi.

## Overview
This project simulates the dynamics of a two-level quantum system driven by a time-dependent Hamiltonian.  
The numerical integration (using the Runge–Kutta 4th-order method) models transition probabilities and visualizes how coupling strength and frequency affect the system evolution.

## Contents
- `landau_zener_simulation.py` — main numerical solver  
- `Landau_Zener_Report.pdf` — project summary and analysis report  

*(Note: The attached report was part of a group submission. The numerical simulations and Python code uploaded here were developed by me.)*

## Methods
- Solved the time-dependent Schrödinger equation using RK4 integration  
- Performed parameter sweeps for coupling strength and oscillation frequency  
- Visualized transition probabilities with Matplotlib  

## Tools Used
Python (NumPy, Matplotlib)
